Subject: [PATCH 13/28] Add GCC 4.8.2 patch for crtstuff.c

.. it directly included auto-host.h, it shouldn't, instead
tconfig.h includes that file, but only after defining
USED_FOR_TARGET so that things only needed for the host
are not defined when building target libraries and objects

++/* Actually don't include this as it breaks building on Windows where
++   caddr_t is defined as "char *" by auto-host.h, which causes glibc's
++   sys/types.h to fall over at "typedef __caddr_t caddr_t;". auto-host.h
++   is included in-directly via tconfig.h and that correctly defines
++   USED_FOR_TARGET first meaning the define of caddr_t isn't done.
++   There is another fix for this:
++   https://sourceware.org/ml/crossgcc/2011-12/msg00077.html
++   .. but until I see this fix causing problems, it seems like the
++   cleanest way. I'm guessing the original FIXME comment has been fixed
++   by using tconfig.h and USED_FOR_TARGET?
